<h2> About this project: </h2>

This repository is my project for the [Text Classificaiton Algorithms Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/clasificacion-texto-2020/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2> Brief description : </h2>

In this projects, we explore some of main concepts of machine learning for text classification. Some of these concepts include:

- Markov Chains
- Hidden Markov Model
- Viterbi Algorithms
- Maximum-Entropy Makov Model
- Naive Bayes Algorithm

Some of the application of these concepts include document and word classification, labeling and feeling on text detection.
